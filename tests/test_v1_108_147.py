"""v1.108.147 — #370: concurrent cold searches must not repeat whole-index work.

Two thundering-herd defects on Windows-scale indexes (665k symbols, ~0.5 GB
SQLite): (1) load_index's cold path hydrated the same repository once per
concurrent caller (the cache check was locked but the hydration was not), and
(2) the per-index _bm25_cache check-then-build was unsynchronized, so every
cold search independently built the full-corpus BM25/centrality state.

Fixes: a per-repo single-flight lock around load_index's cold hydration, and a
per-CodeIndex ``_bm25_lock`` used double-checked at every _bm25_cache build
site (search_symbols x3, get_ranked_context x4, plan_turn, find_implementations,
get_repo_map) plus register_edit's clear.
