"""Tests for v1.108.86 — `watch-all` announces its steady state (#357 follow-up).

`watch-all` is a long-lived foreground daemon: it indexes, then blocks watching
for edits. The post-index silence was read as a hang twice (@zakblacki). It now
prints a one-time guidance line naming the Ctrl+C / `watch-install` options.
