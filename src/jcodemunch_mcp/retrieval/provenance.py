"""Confidence provenance — every confidence number traces to a stated basis.

Phase A of the self-attesting retrieval contract: a confidence constant the
suite emits is either

- ``measured`` — backed by a committed, reproducible benchmark artifact
  (``benchmarks/provenance/measured.json``, drift-guarded by
  ``tests/test_provenance.py``), or
- ``declared`` — an engineering prior, honestly labeled as such.

The rule this module enforces culturally and the tests enforce mechanically:
**never present a prior as a measurement.** A ``declared`` entry graduates to
``measured`` only when a gold-labeled corpus exists for it; until then the
label tells the caller exactly how much weight the number can bear.

Wheel installs don't ship ``benchmarks/``, so measured values are embedded
here as constants with a ``source`` pointing at the committed artifact; the
in-repo test suite asserts the two never diverge (the SigMap-style drift
guard, built in our idiom).
